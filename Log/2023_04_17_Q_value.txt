Added calibration functions for 10cm and 40cm (only Eu sources). The calibration for 10 and 40 cm looks pretty good. Need some minor adjustments (will double check this with Andrew). Still need to fix calibration for 18cm (Ba). 

Made a script to calculate the Q value for possible reaction products.  

Ask Andrew:
