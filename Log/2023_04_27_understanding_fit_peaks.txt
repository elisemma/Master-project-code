Questions to the code on this website:

- Why is sp.isotopes called two times with different number of isotopes?
- line 5: what is gammas=xxx.gammas()
- line 5: what is istp_col?
-  In the fit peaks function, one can pass an argument for "gammas" with a list/dictionary/pandas dataframe.
    What is the purpose of this?
    Does it allow for other transitions which are unknown, i.e. the source isotopes is not known? This seems like what the guide suggests, as the isotope argument is optional.
    In the example that is online, the code seems to have an error running depending on what the energy of the peak is. It seems like it needs to be a known transition for one of the listed isotopes... but then sometimes known energies don't work.
    For completeness, arbitrary energies for contaminant peaks don't seem to work (1807 keV)... and yet, for some arbitrary numbers (1100.0 keV)?

    Is there comprehensive example/script for Curie that can be used to learn from as the guide seems to be a bit scarce on some aspects.
- Can I improve a fit for
