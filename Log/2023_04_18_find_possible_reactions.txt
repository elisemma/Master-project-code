Found and fixed a major problem with my q-value calculations. 

In find_reaction_products.py I have two functions to find which isotopes are produced:

1. def find_possible_reaction_products_from_d_Xn_reactions(Zr_isotopes, Zr_masses, Nb_isotopes, Nb_masses):
    This function finds all the possible reaction products through the (d,Xn) reactions by calculating Q value and looking at the beam energy.


2. def find_possible_reaction_products_from_d_pXn_reactions(Zr_target_isotopes, Zr_target_masses, Zr_prod_isotopes, Zr_prod_masses)
    This function finds all the possible reaction products through the (d,pXn) reactions by calculating Q value and looking at the beam energy.
    The last part of this function does not work yet and is commented out. The last part should calcluate the possible reaction products when 96Zr is the target.
