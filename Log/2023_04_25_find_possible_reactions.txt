Yesterday I changed the find_reaction_products file and today I found and fixed a small bug in the same file. 

The file consists of:
- Q-value function which calculates the Q-value and takes two lists of masses as input; one for the initial masses and one for the final masses.

- A find_possible_reactoions_verbose function which takes information about the target and reaction product as input and checks which reactions are possible if any.
  This function also prints out the Q-value and has a lot of output. Therefore this function is suitable for a few reactions at a time when you want a lot of information.

- A find_possible_reactions function which does the same as the one above, but dont have any printing to the terminal and instead returns a list of possible reactions.

- A function to iterate over two dictionaries (one with all possible target nuclei and one with all possible products) and prints out the possible reactions for each 
  product.

NB: The disadvantage of having two separate functions which more or less do the same, is that one have to remember to do all changes in both functions when changing the 
code. Therefore it might be a good idea to implement both functions in one code, but add a boolian input variable called "verbose" or "printing" or something.
