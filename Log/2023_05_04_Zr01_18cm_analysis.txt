Trying to identify all radionuclei seen in the spectrum: 'BA130217_Zr01_18cm_30MeV'.
Have found almost all the peaks by using my Q-value code. Peaks that had to be investigated:

- 1807keV: Went through all candidates on the Table of radiative isotopes website Andrew showed me and non of
  the radionuclides made a fit for the 1807 peak except 26Al. The problem with this radionuclide is the very
  long half-life (7e5 years), but this nuclei has a E=1808 peak with I=99.76. Maybe 27Al(d,dn)26Al, but because 
  of the long half-life sooo much of this reaction must have happend... 
  Search settings on the website was: 10Â´804-1810keV, 1<=A<=98

- 1296keV: Did not find any fits for this peak.. settings on the website: 1294-1298keV, 1<=A<=98
