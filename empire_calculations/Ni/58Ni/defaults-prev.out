 Nuclear reaction model code EMPIRE-3.2.3 Malta 
 (SVN rev. 5094 )
 by M.W.Herman et al [EMP,EMP-man].

 EMPIRE dimensions (dimension.h):
  NDNUC= 600  NDEXCLUS= 50  NDEX= 101  NDLW= 120
  LEVCC= 40  NDLV= 40  NDBR= 40  NDMSCS= 4
 
 CROSS-SECTION EVALUATION PROCEDURE                 
 
 Adopted procedure is based on careful theoretical  
 analysis utilizing available experimental data and 
 nuclear reaction model calculations.               

 This code integrates into a single system a number 
 of important modules and features:                 
                                                    
 - Spherical and deformed Optical Model including   
   coupled-channels code ECIS06 by J. Raynal        
 - Soft-rotator deformed Optical Model including    
   coupled-channels code OPTMAN by E.Soukhovitskii  
   and coworkers                                    
 - Hauser-Feshbach statistical model including      
   width fluctuation correction, and the       
   optical model for fission with partial damping   
 - Quantum-mechanical MSD TUL model (codes ORION &  
   TRISTAN by H.Lenske), and MSC NVWY model         
 - Exciton model with Iwamoto-Harada cluster        
   emission and Kalbach systematic angular distr.   
   (code PCROSS by R.Capote et al)                  
 - Hybrid Monte Carlo preequilibrium model(M.Blann) 
   (code DDHMS by M.Chadwick, mod. by B.V.Carlson)  
 - Complete gamma-ray cascade after emission of     
   each particle, including realistic treatment of  
   discrete transitions                             
 - Access to OM segment of the RIPL library [RIPL]  
 - Built-in input parameter files, such as masses,  
   level density, discrete levels, fission barriers 
   and gamma strength functions based on the RIPL   
   library [RIPL]                                   
 - Automatic retrieval of experimental data from the
   EXFOR library                                    
 - ENDF-6 formatting (code EMPEND by A.Trkov)       
   coupled to graphical presentation capabilities   
   (code ZVView by V. Zerkin) through the chain of  
   PrePro codes by D. Cullen                        
 - ENDF checking codes (CHECKR, FIZCON, PSYCHE)     
 - Highly automated fitting of optical model        
   parameters (by B.V. Carlson)                     
 - KALMAN code for fitting experimental data and    
 - generating covariances                           
 - Support for NJOY                                 
                                                    
                                                    
 PARAMETERIZATIONS                                  
                                                    
 Following models and parameters were used in the   
 current evaluation:                                
                                                    
 Discrete levels were taken from the RIPL-3+        
 library based on the 2015 version of ENSDF.        
 ENDF formatting disabled
 EMPIRE-specific level densities (J>>K aprox.)
 RIPL empirical fission barriers used for all nuclei
 CN decay and Direct cross sections added incoherently
 CN angular distribution assumed isotropic
 Traditional Hauser-Feschbach Tlj_{CC}(E)=Tlj_{GS}(E-Egs)
 E1 strength function set to RIPL MLO1
 GDR parameters from RIPL/Exp.data+Plujko systematics
 Gamma-transition multipolarity set to    2
