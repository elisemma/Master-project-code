13.04.23: 
Started the calibration in calibration.py. Want to make one function for each position. Have written a function to calibrate at the position 18cm and 50cm.
- 18cm: The calibration spectrum for the Eu152 spectra don't look good. The curve for the resolution calibration looks really wierd. Looks like the regression 
dosen't work. I am not saving the calibration (json files) until the calibration looks good.
- 50cm: No peaks found in the Eu spectrum. One peak in the Ba spectrum might be a bit off. The three calibration graphs look pretty good.
