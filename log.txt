13.04.23: 
Started the calibration in calibration.py. Want to make one function for each position. Have written a function to calibrate at the position 18cm.
The calibration spectra for the Eu152 spectras don't look good. The curve for the resolution calibration looks really wierd. Looks like the regression 
dosen't work.
